<h4 align="center">In <a href="https://majhirockzz.github.io/HTML5-and-CSS3-Project-5/" target="_blank">Restaurant Reviews</a> projects we incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, we have been given a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We have also converted this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.</h4>

## Key Features

- Leaflet.js & MapBox for maps.
- Responsive design.
- ServiceWorker features.
- Works Offline.

## How To Use

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.
